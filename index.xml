      <title>Tips &amp; Caveats</title>

      <description>Running an application that uses SQLite and Litestream can require some small tweaks to optimize performance and usability. There are also some important caveats to know.
Busy timeout SQLite is built to run as a multi-process embedded database and Litestream acts as just another process. However, Litestream requires periodic but short write locks on the database when checkpointing occurs. SQLite will return an error by default if your application tries to obtain a write lock at the same time.</description>

      <description>This tutorial will get you up and running with Litestream locally and replicating an SQLite database to an S3-compatible store called MinIO. This works the same as Amazon S3 but it&amp;rsquo;s easier to get started.
By the end, you&amp;rsquo;ll understand the replicate and restore commands and be able to continuously backup your database. It assumes you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable on the command line and have Docker installed.
⏱ You should expect this tutorial to take about 10 minutes.</description>

      <title>How it works</title>

      <description>Litestream is a streaming replication tool for SQLite databases. It runs as a separate background process and continuously copies write-ahead log pages from disk to one or more replicas. This asynchronous replication provides disaster recovery similar to what is available with database servers like Postgres or MySQL.
Understanding the WAL SQLite has a journaling mode called &amp;ldquo;WAL&amp;rdquo; (write-ahead log) which writes database page changes to a separate -wal file first before later copying those pages back into the main database file.</description>
