This guide will show you how to use [DigitalOcean Spaces][spaces] as a database
replica path for Litestream. You will need a [DigitalOcean][do] account to
complete this guide.


## Setup

### Create a space

In the [DigitalOcean Console][console], click on the green _"Create"_ button
in the top navigation and choose _"Spaces"_. You may need to enable spaces on
your account you have not already. 

On the _"Create a Space"_ screen, you'll need to choose a region and name your
space a globally unique name. Then click the _"Create a Space"_ button at the
bottom of the screen.

After your space is created, you'll see the replica hostname of your space 
that includes your space name and region followed by `digitaloceanspaces.com`.
You'll need to use that later when configuring Litestream.

### Create a key

You'll need to create a key to authenticate Litestream to your account so it can
access the space. In the Spaces UI, click the _"Manage Keys"_ button. This will
bring up the _Applications & API_ screen.

Scroll down to the _Spaces access keys_ section and click the _"Generate New
Key"_ button. You'll need to provide a name for key and then hit Enter. You'll 
be presented with the access key id and secret access key. **You will need to
copy those for use later.**

## Usage

### Command line usage

You can replicate to [DigitalOcean Spaces][spaces] from the command line by
setting environment variables with the credentials you obtained after creating
your key:

```sh
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/xxxxxxxxx
```

Then you can specify your replica hostname as a replica URL on the command line.
For example, you can replicate a database to your space with the following command.
_Note that your region may be different._

```sh
litestream replicate /path/to/db s3://SPACENAME.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/db
```

You can later restore your database from DigitalOcean Spaces to a local `my.db`
path with the following command.

```sh
litestream restore -o my.db s3://SPACENAME.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/db
```

### Configuration file usage

Litestream is typically run as a background service which uses a configuration
file. You can configure a replica for your database using the `url` format.
_Note that your region may be different._

```yaml
access-key-id=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
secret-access-key=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/xxxxxxxxx

dbs:
  - path: /path/to/local/db
    replicas:
      - url: s3://SPACENAME.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/db
```

Or you can expand your configuration into multiple fields:

```yaml
dbs:
  - path: /path/to/local/db
    replicas:
      - type: s3
        bucket:   SPACENAME
        path:     db
        endpoint: nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
        region:   nyc3   # set to your region
```

You may also specify your key credentials on a per-replica basis:

```yaml
dbs:
  - path: /path/to/local/db
    replicas:
      - url: s3://SPACENAME.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/db
        access-key-id=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
        secret-access-key=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/xxxxxxxxx
```


## Important Note

It is common to see errors in the Litestream log when using DigitalOcean Spaces.
Typically, it shows a `send request failed` error followed by a `connection
reset by peer` error. This seems to be a socket that closes early on
DigitalOcean's servers. 

Litestream is built to handle many types of failures so these requests will be
retried on the next sync attempt which is 10 seconds later by default. While
it's always troublesome to see errors, these do not affect the integrity of your
backups.
