This guide will show you how to use Litestream to replicate to a [Google Cloud
Storage][] bucket. You will need a [Google Cloud][] account and to complete
this guide.

[Google Cloud Storage]: https://cloud.google.com/storage
[Google Cloud]: https://cloud.google.com/


## Setup

### Create a bucket

In the [GCP Console][], use the top search bar to navigate to _"Cloud Storage"_.
You may need to enable storage and billing if you have not previously set it up.

Next, click the _"Create Bucket"_ button. Enter a globally unique bucket name
and click the _"Create"_ button.

[GCP Console]: https://console.cloud.google.com/


### Create a service account

You'll need to set up a service account to authenticate into GCP and access your
bucket. From the top search bar, navigate to _"Service Accounts"_. Enter a name
for your service account and click the _"Create"_ button.

Next, you'll need to grant the _Storage Object Creator_ and _Storage Object
Viewer_ roles to your service accounts so they can read & write data. Then
click the _"Done"_ button.

After your account has been created, click on it and go to the _"Keys"_
subsection. Click the _"Add Key"_ drop-down and select _"Create new key"_.
Choose the _"JSON"_ option.

This will download a JSON file to your local computer. Move it to a safe
location and set an environment variable pointing to its path:

```sh
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/xxxxxxx.json
```

## Usage

### Command line usage

You can specify your replica as a replica URL on the command line. For example,
you can replicate a database to your bucket. _Replace the placeholders with your
bucket & path._

```sh
litestream replicate /path/to/db gcs://BUCKET/PATH
```

You can later restore your database from Google Cloud Storage to a local `my.db`
path with the following command.

```sh
litestream restore -o my.db gcs://BUCKET/PATH
```

### Configuration file usage

Litestream is typically run as a background service which uses a [configuration
file][]. You can configure a replica for your database using the `url` format.

```yaml
dbs:
  - path: /path/to/local/db
    replicas:
      - url: gcs://BUCKET/PATH
```

Or you can expand your configuration into multiple fields:

```yaml
dbs:
  - path: /path/to/local/db
    replicas:
      - type:   gcs
        bucket: BUCKET
        path:   PATH
```
