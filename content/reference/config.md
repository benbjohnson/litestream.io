The YAML configuration file provides a way to list databases and replicas that
Litestream should manage. In addition, there are global variables that can be
applied to all replicas.

The default path for the configuration file is `/etc/litestream.yml`.

### Variable expansion

By default, Litestream will perform environment variable expansion within the
config file before reading it. Any references to `$VAR` or `${VAR}` formatted
variables will be replaced with their environment variable values. If no value
is set then it will be replaced with an empty string.

This can cause issues if you have a value in a configuration file which has a
dollar sign followed by characters—for example, a password. In this case, you
can set the `-no-expand-env` flag on any `litestream` command to disable
expansion.


## Global settings

### AWS credentials

If you are using AWS S3 replication, it can be useful to specify your
credentials in one place instead of for each replica:

```yaml
access-key-id:     AKIAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
secret-access-key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/xxxxxxxxx
```


### Metrics

Litestream produces a continuous stream of metrics that are exported as a
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) endpoint. These are disabled by default
as it requires an HTTP server to start. You can enable it by setting a bind
address in the config:

```yaml
addr: ":9090"
```

When you start Litestream with this setting enabled, you'll see metrics at
[http://localhost:9090/metrics](http://localhost:9090/metrics)


### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

{{< since version="0.5.0" >}} Litestream includes built-in support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP),
allowing AI assistants to interact with your databases and replicas. Enable the MCP server
by setting a bind address:

```yaml
mcp-addr: ":3001"
```

When enabled, the MCP server will start alongside replication and provide AI tools at
[http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001). See the [MCP command reference]({{< ref "mcp" >}}) for available tools and usage.


### Logging

{{< since version="0.3.12" >}} Log `type` can be set to either "text" or "json".
Logging `level` can be set to "debug", "info", "warn" or "error". By setting
`stderr` to `true` logs will be written to stderr instead of stdout.

The defaults are shown below:

```yaml
logging:
  level: info
  type: text
  stderr: false
```


## Database settings

Litestream can monitor one or more database files that are specified in the
configuration file. Database files are also referenced in `litestream` commands
by their absolute path.

Each database configuration includes the database path and replica configuration.
{{< since version="0.5.0" >}} Database configuration has been simplified to use a single
`replica` field instead of the deprecated `replicas` array.

```yaml
dbs:
  - path: /var/lib/db1
    replica:
      url: s3://mybkt.litestream.io/db1

  - path: /var/lib/db2
    replica:
      url: nats://nats.example.com:4222/my-bucket
      username: litestream
      password: ${NATS_PASSWORD}
```

### Database configuration options

Each database supports the following configuration options:

- `path`—Absolute path to the SQLite database file
- `meta-path`—Path to store Litestream metadata (defaults to `<path>-litestream`)
- `monitor-interval`—How often to check for changes (default: `1s`)
- `checkpoint-interval`—How often to perform WAL checkpoints (default: `1m`)
- `busy-timeout`—SQLite busy timeout (default: `1s`)
- `min-checkpoint-page-count`—Minimum pages before checkpointing (default: `1000`)
- `max-checkpoint-page-count`—Maximum pages before forcing checkpoint (default: `10000`)
- `replica`—Single replica configuration (replaces deprecated `replicas` array)

Example with database-level options:

```yaml
dbs:
  - path: /var/lib/myapp.db
    meta-path: /var/lib/myapp-litestream
    monitor-interval: 500ms
    checkpoint-interval: 30s
    busy-timeout: 5s
    min-checkpoint-page-count: 500
    max-checkpoint-page-count: 5000
    replica:
      url: s3://mybucket/myapp
      sync-interval: 1s
```


## Replica settings

Litestream supports six types of replicas:

- `"abs"` replicates a database to an Azure Blob Storage container.
- `"file"` replicates a database to another local file path.
- `"gs"` replicates a database to a Google Cloud Storage bucket.
- `"nats"` replicates a database to a NATS JetStream Object Store.
- `"s3"` replicates a database to an S3-compatible bucket.
- `"sftp"` replicates a database to a remote server via SFTP.

All replicas have unique name which is specified by the `"name"` field. If a
name is not specified then the name defaults to the replica type. The name is
only needed when using multiple replicas of the same type on a database.

The following replica settings are also available for all replica types:

- `url`—Short-hand form of specifying a replica location. Setting this field
  will apply changes to multiples fields including `bucket`, `path`, `region`, etc.

- `retention`—The amount of time that snapshot & LTX files will be kept. After
  the retention period, a new snapshot will be created and the old one will be
  removed. LTX files that exist before the oldest snapshot will also be removed.
  Defaults to `24h`.

- `retention-check-interval`—Specifies how often Litestream will check if
  retention needs to be enforced. Defaults to `1h`.

- `snapshot-interval`—Specifies how often new snapshots will be created. This is
  used to reduce the time to restore since newer snapshots will have fewer LTX
  frames to apply. Retention still applies to these snapshots.

  If you do not set a snapshot interval then a new snapshot will be created
  whenever retention is performed. Retention occurs every 24 hours by default.


- `validation-interval`—When specified, Litestream will automatically restore
  and validate that the data on the replica matches the local copy. Disabled by
  default. Enabling this will significantly increase the cost of running
  Litestream as S3 services charge for downloads.

- `sync-interval`—Frequency in which frames are pushed to the replica. Defaults
  to `1s`. Increasing frequency can increase cloud storage costs significantly.

- `age`—Client-side encryption with [age](https://age-encryption.org), see
  [Encryption](#encryption) for configuration details. Defaults to off.


### S3 replica

The easiest way to configure an S3 replica is to use the `url` field:

```yaml
dbs:
  - path: /var/lib/db
    replicas:
      - url: s3://mybkt.litestream.io/db
```

However, you can break this out into separate fields as well:

```yaml
dbs:
  - path: /var/lib/db
    replicas:
      - type:   s3
        bucket: mybkt.litestream.io
        path:   db
```

In addition, you can specify the region and AWS credentials per-replica:

```yaml
dbs:
  - path: /var/lib/db
    replicas:
      - url: s3://mybkt.litestream.io/db
        region: us-east-1
        access-key-id: AKIAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
        secret-access-key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/xxxxxxxxx
```

The following settings are specific to S3 replicas:

- `access-key-id`—Replica-specific authentication key. If not specified, the
  global key or the `LITESTREAM_ACCESS_KEY_ID` environment variable will be used
  instead. The `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` variable can also be used.

- `secret-access-key`—Replica-specific secret key. If not specified, the global
  secret or the `LITESTREAM_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable will be used
  instead. The `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` variable can also be used.

- `bucket`—Specifies the name of the remote bucket to replicate to.

- `path`—Specifies the path to use within the bucket.

- `region`—Specifies the bucket's region. Only used for AWS S3 & Backblaze B2.

- `endpoint`—Specifies the endpoint URL of the S3-compatible service. Only
  required for non-AWS services.

- `force-path-style`—Uses the path style which is required by non-AWS services.
  This is automatically enabled if `endpoint` is set.

- `skip-verify`—Disables TLS verification. This is useful when testing against
  a local node such as MinIO and you are using self-signed certificates.


### File replica

File replicas can be configured using the `"path"` field:

```yaml
dbs:
  - path: /var/lib/db
    replicas:
      - path: /backup/db
```

If no `"type"` field is specified and a `"url"` is not used then `"file"` is
assumed.


### Google Cloud Storage (GCS) replica

GCS replicas can be configured using the `url` field:

```yaml
dbs:
  - path: /var/lib/db
    replica:
      url: gs://mybucket.example.com/db
```

Or by specifying individual fields:

```yaml
dbs:
  - path: /var/lib/db
    replica:
      type: gs
      bucket: mybucket.example.com
      path: db
```

GCS authentication uses Google Application Default Credentials (ADC). Set the
`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to point to your service
account key file, or use workload identity in GKE environments.


### Azure Blob Storage (ABS) replica

{{< since version="0.5.0" >}} Updated to use Azure SDK v2.

ABS replicas can be configured using the `url` field:

```yaml
dbs:
  - path: /var/lib/db
    replica:
      url: abs://account@myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/container/db
```

Or by specifying individual fields:

```yaml
dbs:
  - path: /var/lib/db
    replica:
      type: abs
      account-name: myaccount
      account-key: ${AZURE_ACCOUNT_KEY}
      bucket: container
      path: db
      endpoint: https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/
```

The following settings are specific to ABS replicas:

- `account-name`—Azure storage account name
- `account-key`—Azure storage account key or use `AZURE_STORAGE_KEY` environment variable
- `bucket`—Container name within the storage account
- `path`—Path within the container
- `endpoint`—Custom endpoint URL (optional)


### SFTP replica

SFTP replicas allow replication to remote servers via SSH File Transfer Protocol:

```yaml
dbs:
  - path: /var/lib/db
    replica:
      url: sftp://user:password@example.com:22/backup/db
```

Or with individual fields:

```yaml
dbs:
  - path: /var/lib/db
    replica:
      type: sftp
      host: example.com:22
      user: backup-user
      password: ${SFTP_PASSWORD}
      key-path: /etc/litestream/sftp_key
      path: /backup/db
```

The following settings are specific to SFTP replicas:

- `host`—SFTP server hostname and port
- `user`—Username for authentication
- `password`—Password for authentication (not recommended for production)
- `key-path`—Path to SSH private key file for key-based authentication
- `path`—Remote path where replica files will be stored


### NATS JetStream Object Store replica

{{< since version="0.5.0" >}} NATS JetStream Object Store provides distributed storage.

NATS replicas can be configured using the `url` field:

```yaml
dbs:
  - path: /var/lib/db
    replica:
      url: nats://nats.example.com:4222/my-bucket
      username: litestream
      password: ${NATS_PASSWORD}
```

Or with individual fields:

```yaml
dbs:
  - path: /var/lib/db
    replica:
      type: nats
      bucket: my-bucket
      username: litestream
      password: ${NATS_PASSWORD}
      
      # TLS configuration
      tls: true
      root-cas:
        - /etc/ssl/certs/nats-ca.crt
      client-cert: /etc/ssl/certs/nats-client.crt
      client-key: /etc/ssl/private/nats-client.key
      
      # Connection tuning
      max-reconnects: -1
      reconnect-wait: 2s
      timeout: 10s
```

The following settings are specific to NATS replicas:

**Connection Settings:**

- `bucket`—NATS JetStream Object Store bucket name (must be pre-created)
- `max-reconnects`—Maximum reconnection attempts (-1 for unlimited)
- `reconnect-wait`—Wait time between reconnection attempts
- `timeout`—Connection timeout

**Authentication Options (choose one):**

- `username` & `password`—Basic username/password authentication
- `jwt` & `seed`—JWT token and seed for NATS 2.0 authentication
- `creds`—Path to NATS credentials file
- `nkey`—NKey for signature-based authentication
- `token`—Simple token authentication

**TLS Options:**

- `tls`—Enable TLS encryption
- `root-cas`—List of CA certificate file paths
- `client-cert`—Client certificate for mutual TLS
- `client-key`—Client private key for mutual TLS

See the [NATS Integration Guide]({{< ref "nats" >}}) for detailed setup instructions.


### Legacy Multiple Replicas

{{< alert icon="⚠️" text="Multiple replicas per database are deprecated. Use a single replica configuration instead." >}}

Previous versions supported multiple replicas per database using the `replicas` array.
This has been simplified to use a single `replica` field:

**Deprecated (v0.3.x and earlier):**

```yaml
dbs:
  - path: /local/path/to/db
    replicas:
      - name: my_aws_replica
        url: s3://myawsbucket/db
      - name: my_do_replica
        url: s3://mybkt.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/db
```

**Current (v0.5.0+):**

```yaml
dbs:
  - path: /local/path/to/db
    replica:
      url: s3://myawsbucket/db
```

If you need multiple backup destinations, consider using your cloud provider's
cross-region replication features or multiple Litestream instances.


### Retention period

Replicas maintain a snapshot of the database as well as a contiguous sequence of
SQLite WAL page updates. These updates take up space so new snapshots are
created and old WAL files are dropped through a process called "retention".

The default retention period is `24h`. You can change that with the `retention`
field. Retention is enforced periodically and defaults to every `1h`. This can
be changed with the `retention-check-interval` field.

```
dbs:
  - path: /var/lib/db
    replicas:
      - url: s3://mybkt.litestream.io/db
        retention: 4h
```

Duration values can be specified using second (`s`), minute (`m`), or hour (`h`)
but days, weeks, & years are not supported.


### Validation interval

Because Litestream performs physical replication, the resulting database files
restored from replicas will match byte-for-byte. Litestream has an option to
periodically validate replicas by restoring them and comparing their checksum
to the primary database's checksum.

_Please note that frequently restoring from S3 can be expensive._

It can be enabled by setting the `validation-interval` field:

```
dbs:
  - path: /var/lib/db
    replicas:
      - url: s3://mybkt.litestream.io/db
        validation-interval: 6h
```

### Encryption

{{< since version="0.3.10" >}} Client-side encryption can be enabled per replica by adding an `age` section to
the replica configuration with corresponding `identities` and `recipients`
fields.

{{< alert icon="❗️" text="When enabling encryption restoring requires matching age identity to restore from the replica." >}}

```yaml
dbs:
  - path: /var/lib/db
    replica:
      url: s3://mybkt.litestream.io/db
      age:
        identities:
          - AGE-SECRET-KEY-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        recipients:
          - age1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

To generate keys, refer to the
age [README](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/blob/main/README.md)
how to install and use the command line tools.

As of now identities must be a superset of recipients but key rotation can be
achieved by adding a new identity while changing the recipient list to only have
a key for it.

Note that enabling encryption after replication has already been done can
confuse Litestream so it is recommended the replica is empty when doing so.
Restoring from a replica that has mixed encrypted and non-encrypted files will
fail.

#### Identity Files

{{< since version="0.5.0" >}} You can also reference identity files instead of embedding keys directly:

```yaml
dbs:
  - path: /var/lib/db
    replica:
      url: s3://mybkt.litestream.io/db
      age:
        identities:
          - /etc/litestream/age-identity.txt
        recipients:
          - age1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
